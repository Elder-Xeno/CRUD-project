# Shelfie - Board Game Collection App

## Description

Shelfie  is a user-friendly web application designed for board game enthusiasts to manage their game library effectively. Featuring an intuitive and visually appealing user interface, this app simplifies the process of organizing and keeping track of board games.

Users can effortlessly add new games to their collection using a clean and easy-to-navigate UI. The addition of filtering and search functionality enhances the user experience, making it easier to find specific games based on various criteria such as genre, mechanics and player count. The application also allows users to keep track of the game titles they have recently played, who they played with and any other additonal notes. For games already in their library, users can conveniently add and edit games, as well as log play details through the game's "show" screen with ease.
